# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Overview

This repository contains code and resources for building a credit card fraud detection model using machine learning techniques. The goal of this project is to develop a model that can effectively identify fraudulent credit card transactions in a highly imbalanced dataset.

### Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains credit card transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013. It includes a mix of legitimate and fraudulent transactions. Here are some key details about the dataset:

- Number of transactions: 284,807
- Number of fraud cases: 492
- Class imbalance: Positive class (frauds) accounts for only 0.172% of all transactions
- Features: Numerical features obtained through PCA transformation, 'Time,' and 'Amount'
- Target variable: 'Class' (1 for fraud, 0 for legitimate)

## Data Preprocessing

- Checked for missing values (no null values in the dataset).
- Explored the distribution of transaction amounts for both legitimate and fraudulent transactions.
- Balanced the dataset by performing random undersampling of the majority class (Class 0) to match the number of samples in the minority class (Class 1).
- Split the data into training and testing sets (80/20 split) while maintaining class distribution using stratified splitting.

## Model Building

- Trained a logistic regression model on the preprocessed data.
- Evaluated the model using the Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC) as the primary metric, considering the class imbalance.
- AUPRC takes into account both precision and recall, making it suitable for unbalanced classification.

## Results
The logistic regression model achieved an AUPRC of approximately X.XX on the test dataset, indicating its effectiveness in detecting fraudulent transactions, considering the class imbalance.
